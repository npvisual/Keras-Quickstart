# Keras Quickstart

## Introduction

`Keras Quickstart` is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) which was created as a result of my first experiments with [Keras](https://keras.io). It doesn't provide any original content -- unless you count the rumblings of frustration and my snarly comments as such !

The notebook is heavily influenced by original (?) work ([here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [here](https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python)) around the MNIST dataset and also by the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io).

## Getting started
If you already have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) installed, then you simply need to download the [Getting Started notebook]() and run it.

## Notebook Viewer

If you have not installed [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) (doh ! what are you waiting for ?), you can still view the notebook online.
